My first attempt at building a static website from scratch - When completed it will be used by a family member for their business.

The goal is to implement a static site using pure HTML & CSS, I will look to add some jQuery or Javascript if required. The site will not use bootsrap and in the beginning the site will not be responsive.

After I complete my next course on HTML & CSS I will be looking to build my own responsive framework which I will use to update this site to conform to the modern standards of responsive design. I will also be trying to document the development of both this website and my learning experience through a blog.
